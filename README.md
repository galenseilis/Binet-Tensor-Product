# Binet-Tensor-Product
[Jacques Binet](http://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Binet.html) is thought to have developed the formalizations for the [matrix product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_multiplication). In this work I am developing an extension to his idea, and in his recognition I would like to name this extension after him as the *Binet Tensor Product* (BTP).
